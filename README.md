# Hacknotes 

## A personal collection of notes and tools for hackers. 

I'm new to the hacking scene and I'm exploring and learning to "hack" to prepar myself for the OSCP exam. 
This repo is first for my personal use, and second, for all those people that need to study for OSCP or that want to have a ready to consult operative manual.
